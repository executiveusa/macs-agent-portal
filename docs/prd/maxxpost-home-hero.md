# PRD: MAXX-POST Homepage (Agent 006)

## 1. Executive Summary

The MAXX-POST homepage is a high-octane, immersive scroll experience introducing "Agent 006" (the canine mascot) and the "Mustang MAXX" vehicle. It serves as the front door to the MACS Digital Media autonomous AI agency. The experience mimics the 007 Spyscape structure but is reskinned with a "Comic-book Noir" aesthetic—rainy Seattle streets, neon lights, and sepia comic panels.

## 2. Goals

- **Immerse User**: Create a "wow" moment with parallax narration and seamless scroll animations.
- **Showcase Brand**: Establish the "Noir/AI" aesthetic of MACS Digital Media.
- **Drive Conversion**: Funnel users to "Enter the Agency" (Login/Dashboard) or "Subscribe" (Payment).

## 3. Narrative Beats (The Scroll)

1.  **The Hook (Hero)**: Full-screen cinematic. Agent 006 in the Mustang, rain pouring, "The Agency is Watching" tagline.
2.  **The Agent (Briefing)**: Meet Agent 006. "Not your average good boy." Dossier-style reveal.
3.  **The Ride (Car Feature)**: Horizontal scroll section pinning the Mustang. User scrolls to reveal/activate gadgets (AI Core, Crypto-drive).
4.  **The Arsenal (Tech)**: Vertical scroll through blueprints of the AI pipelines (websites, avatars).
5.  **The Mission (Context)**: Comic panels showing a successful "mission" (project delivery).
6.  **Footer**: Final CTA.

## 4. Key User Flows

- **Visitor -> Explorer**: User scrolls, interacts with car hotspots, reads comic bubbles.
- **Visitor -> Subscriber**: User clicks "Unlock Gadgets" -> Payment Modal (Stripe/BTC).
- **Client -> Dashboard**: User clicks "Enter Agency" -> `/dashboard`.

## 5. Agency Dashboard (Shell)

- **Concept**: "The Batcomputer" meets "Linear.app".
- **Sections**:
  - **Avatar Factory**: Create persona.
  - **Site Templates**: Deploy web3 sites.
  - **Billing**: Manage crypto/fiat sub.

## 6. Success Metrics

- Average Time on Page > 45s.
- Scroll Depth > 75%.
- "Enter Agency" Click-through Rate > 5%.
